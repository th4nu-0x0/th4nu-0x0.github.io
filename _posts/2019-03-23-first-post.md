Hello everyone in this blog post I wanna share how I bypassed payment and got things for free two times using two different techniques. Before diving into how I bypassed here's a short redacted glance of how the application/feature works. The application allows users to host events and sell tickets. Ok, this is enough for you to understand the Bug so let's get into the fun part.
My approach to hacking web applications is I get deep into the application by walking manually through every feature and understand them. And I'll stick to the feature which interests me the most. In this application, the first thing that caught my eye was selling tickets, an organizer can sell tickets for money or make it available for free.
Nice!
